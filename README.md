<h2>Description</h2>
Pig E. Bank, a global finance company, aimed to reduce customer churn by identifying which users were most at risk of leaving. 
<h2>Goal</h2>
To help Pig E. Bank identify customers at high risk of closing their accounts, enabling the company to improve retention efforts and reduce churn.
<h2>Context & Duration</h2>
This predictive analytics project was conducted over 2 weeks using a bank customer dataset provided by CareerFoundry. The focus was on understanding behavioral and demographic factors influencing account closure.
<h2>My Role</h2>
Data Analyst – I conducted statistical analysis and decision tree modeling using Excel to identify churn drivers and support targeted retention strategies.


<h2>Data Source</h2>
CareerFoundry (Banking Customer Dataset)
<h2>Tools Used</h2>
Microsoft Excel (for statistical analysis and decision tree modeling)

<h2>Steps Taken</h2>
I Cleaned the dataset and created new features.
Grouped account status into “Open” and “Closed” to simplify binary classification.
Analyzed demographic variables (age, gender) in relation to churn.
Built a decision tree model to visualize churn likelihood and identify key predictors.

<h2>Key Challenges and Solutions</h2>
Limited dataset granularity and tooling so I used Excel creatively for predictive analysis and visual modeling.

<h2>Analysis and Result</h2>
To better understand customer retention, I began by segmenting the dataset by account status, grouping customers into either ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’ accounts. This binary classification provided a foundation to analyze behavioral and demographic differences between retained and churned customers.Using Excel pivot tables, I calculated key descriptive statistics—including averages, minimums, and maximums for each variable.

<h2>Insights</h2>
79% of accounts remain open, while 21% have been closed.
France and Germany have the highest proportion of closed accounts.
The female demographic leads with 59% of closed accounts.
Open accounts typically have more product holdings than closed ones.
Customers with a bad credit score account for 47% of closed accounts.
Inactive customers represent 70% of closed accounts, compared to 30% for active customers.
The middle-aged group accounts for 53% of closed accounts.
Customers with a high account balance are most likely to close their accounts, followed by those with low balances.
Those with a high estimated salary show the highest rate of account closure, followed closely by those with average salaries.
Most closed accounts are from customers with only one year of tenure.

<h2>Decision Tree showing a client’s likelihood to stay or exit bank</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
At the end of the analysis, I deduced that:


Customers who left were usually older, had lower credit scores, and used fewer products.
Customers who closed their accounts often had more money in their balance than those who stayed. This shows that even valuable customers might leave if they’re not happy.
Customers who used more products were more likely to stay, which means getting people more involved with the bank’s services might improve retention.

These results can help the bank spot which customers might be at risk of leaving—and do something about it early.

This analysis could help the bank to focus on keeping high-value customers who might be unhappy, encourage customers to use more services to increase loyalty
and to target older or less engaged customers with better support or offers


This project helped me practice turning raw data into real insights—and reminded me how important it is to connect what we find in the data to real business decisions.
